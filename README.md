FAQ
----

Q: Can I save any link, image, HTML5 audio and HTML5 video to my Google Drive with Save2Drive?
A: No, but most of them. Save2Drive only works with publicly accessible resources (i.e. resources that do not require you do log in to some account in order to download). However, most web resources *are* publicly accessible. Although from a user's perspective, you do need to log in to see some resources, they can still be publicly accessible, and Save2Drive should work perfectly with them. A Facebook image is a good example of this.

Q: Why not support multiple Google accounts?
A: To the best of my knowledge, multiple account feature can only be supported through the Google Drive API, which does not currently support creating a file from a link. So basically this feature is not possible for the time being.


Privacy
----

Save2Drive needs access to "your data on docs.google.com" *only* to save stuffs to your Google Drive. Save2Drive does *not* read or write your private data in any way.
